  <p> Hello! My name is Joy. I am a data product analyst at the New York Times.</font></p>
  <p> I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles where I studied statistics and did both news reporting and research. In the past, I was a data science intern for the ACLU and a fellow at Impact Labs. I care about data, journalism, tech, and all the avenues in which they intersect. </p>
  <p> I like to do a lot of weird things in my free time, like binge watching Gilmore Girls for the sixth time, quantifying happiness or attempting to understand compatibility. Sometimes I combine both code and words in my work. You can read about it <a href ="https://medium.com/@joygraceeya">here.</a>
