	<p> I am a writer and technologist. In a past life, I was a journalist, researcher and pianist. Currently, I work at the <span class = "just-color">New York Times</span> as a <span class = "just-color">data product analyst.</span> I love learning things no matter how bizzare and enjoy solving problems.</p>
	<p> I graduated from the <span class = "just-color">University of California, Los Angeles</span> where I studied statistics and did both <a href ="https://dailybruin.com/author/joy-harjanto/" class="just_underline">news reporting</a> and <a href ="http://www.lab-paris.com/" class="just_underline">research</a>. I was previously a data science intern for the <span class = "just-color">ACLU</span> and a fellow at <span class = "just-color">Impact Labs</span>. I care about data, journalism, tech, and all the avenues in which they intersect. </p>
	<p> I like to do a lot of a range of things in my free time, recently I picked up bullet journal-ing. Sometimes I get to talk to cool <a href ="https://theparadigma.com/" class="just_underline">people. </a> You can find more of my work <a href ="https://medium.com/@joygraceeya" class="just_underline">here.</a>
