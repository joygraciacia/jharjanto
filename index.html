	<p> Hello! My name is Joy. I am a data product analyst at the New York Times.</span></p>
	<p> I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles where I studied statistics and did both <a href ="https://dailybruin.com/author/joy-harjanto/" class="just_underline">news reporting</a> and <a href ="http://www.lab-paris.com/" class="just_underline">research</a>. In the past, I was a data science intern for the ACLU and a fellow at Impact Labs. I care about data, journalism, tech, and all the avenues in which they intersect. </p>
	<p> I like to do a lot of weird things in my free time, like binge watch Gilmore Girls for the sixth time or contemplate about existential things. Sometimes I combine both code and words in my work. You can find the stuff I do for fun <a href ="https://medium.com/@joygraceeya" class="just_underline">here.</a>
